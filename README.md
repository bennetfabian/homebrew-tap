# bennetfabian's Homebrew tap

Some formulae and casks I use personally that aren't in any of the official Homebrew repositories.

## How do I install these formulae?

`brew install bennetfabian/tap/<formula>`

Or `brew tap bennetfabian/tap` and then `brew install <formula>`.

## Documentation

`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
